## Disk Space Issues

To check disk space usage:

```bash
./scripts/check_disk_space.sh
```

If disk space is low, consider removing unnecessary files or expanding disk capacity.

## Memory Usage Problems

To check memory usage:

```bash
./scripts/check_memory_usage.sh
```

Review processes consuming high memory. Consider closing or optimizing memory-intensive applications.

## Network Connectivity Troubleshooting

To check network connectivity:

```bash
./scripts/check_network.sh
```

If connectivity issues persist, restart networking service:

```bash
./scripts/fix_network_issues.sh
```

## Service Status Checks

To check status of essential services (e.g., SSH):

```bash
./scripts/check_service_status.sh
```

Restart services if necessary:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
```

## System Logs Analysis

To analyze system logs for errors:

```bash
./scripts/check_system_logs.sh
```

Review syslog for any critical errors or warnings.

## Fixing Startup Problems

To troubleshoot and fix startup issues:

```bash
./scripts/fix_startup_issues.sh
```

Check kernel logs for startup errors:

```bash
dmesg | grep error
```
