# Troubleshooting Startup Issues

This document provides troubleshooting steps for resolving startup and boot problems on Ubuntu.

## Common Startup Problems

1. **Boot Failure:**

   - **Check BIOS Settings:** Ensure that the BIOS settings are correctly configured, particularly the boot order and disk settings.
   - **Verify Disk Integrity:** Use `fsck` to check and repair filesystem errors:
     ```bash
     fsck /dev/sda1
     ```

2. **Kernel Panic:**

   - **Check Kernel Logs:** Review kernel logs (`dmesg`) for errors related to hardware or driver issues:
     ```bash
     dmesg | grep error
     ```

3. **Grub Issues:**

   - **Repair Grub Bootloader:** Reinstall Grub on the boot disk:
     ```bash
     sudo grub-install /dev/sda
     sudo update-grub
     ```

4. **Service Initialization Failures:**

   - **Check Failed Services:** Use `systemctl` to check the status of failed services:
     ```bash
     systemctl --failed
     ```
